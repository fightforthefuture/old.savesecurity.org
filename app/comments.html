You can not force companies to make a version of their software that has a backdoor that will let any hacker exploit our financial and personal information!  \n\nApple should not be the government's tech support and what the government is asking will basically make the whole smartphone industry worthless because of the lack of security the request would cause.  I want my credit cards and personal information to stay private!  \n\nHackers have already figured out how to crack the older iPhones and the government should take advantage of those methods.  Heck, my wife showed me an article in a \"Good Housekeeping\" type magazine that showed how to bypass the current security to get into a phone.  If she can unlock an iPhone, surely the government can get the information they need without compromising the privacy of millions of Americans!"

    "comment": "The erosion of our personal securities has to end.  The government has already gone too far invading our homes with unwarranted surveillance of our phone calls, emails and Internet communication.  The last semblance of security and privacy that we have is encryption, much of which the government has already circumvented, through back doors and spending taxpayer dollars to build massive compute clusters capable of decrypting some of the strongest encryptions in a reasonable period of time.\n\nBut here we have a device that too many of us own that has been designed well with our privacy in mind.  The designers did not hold back a secret key, to be leaked into the wild and compromise that security.  The designers protected our interest, we the people.  Yet even her and now the government seeks to force the designer to, not turn over the key, but to create new software, software that is capable of pretending that there was never any security on the device to begin with.  To think that once this exists, that this will be the only time it is used is naive and ignores history.\n\nOnce this code exists, case after case will continue to come in each justified on it's own rights as a few believe this case justifies.  At first it will just be the FBI, but then it will spread.  The number of cases will become so great that it is unreasonable to keep the software contained and limited in it's use, it will become commonplace in every police station across the country.  And at that point, if you believe that it will not have leaked to those who truly seek to harm us, your are far too trusting.  Yet even in the hands of the FBI, who leaked the personal information of 20,000 employees this year alone, cannot be trusted to protect a piece of code so potent.  The personal information that we store in our phones will be available to anyone who truly wants it.\n\nAnd if the FBI can compel Apple to build new code, new product that enables the Government to collect more information on those not accused of a crime, without a warrant, without due process, what then will the Government be able to compel.  Will all of our connected devices be required to send information on us back to be reviewed.  Will LG be required to install cameras in it's refrigerators, GE install listening devices in our ovens?  If Apple can be compelled to build new code, new product in the name of security, then they will have the power to compel anything and we will be powerless.  \n\nWhile some say this case justifies this to happen, I say how.  Are we preventing the attack, that already occurred that was not stopped in spite of the massive invasion of our privacy that has already occurred.  That occurred due to the ineptitude of those who were alerted to the warning signs but did not act.  They already have the power to collect the same information, had they acted before the attack.  This is not about protecting us this is about the FBI being frustrated.  Frustrated that there actually is a device that gives freedom.  Frustrated that they failed to protect us from this attack when all the signs were there, when all the information existed.  This is about control.  Control of the flow of information, our information, the information about our lives.  The attack happened.  Those guilty have been found one executed the other tried and sentenced to death.  This is not about this case, this is about the ability.\n\nWhat do we store on our IPhones? Why is the government so interested in having this ability.  Our phones have access to our entire lives.  Our phone knows where we have been and often where we are going.  Our phones have access to our money and our credit lines.  Our phones can see and hear us.  Our phones know our friends and neighbors, those we talk to and communicate with.  Our phones know our hobbies and our passions.  Our phones know our history.  There is almost nothing about us that our phones do not know.  \n\nOnce the code to expose that information exists, anyone will be able to know us, as our phone does."

What is being demanded of Apple is not to just simply turn over personal information of an individuals, readily at hand. It truth, the requests being made are for Apple to weaken its products security potentially jeopardizing the privacy of anyone who uses an Apple product. \n\nFurthermore, siding with the FBI on this case would open the door to future assaults on privacy and civil rights. Can you with clear conscience say that if the FBI is granted the ability to obtain information in this manor that they would not do it again?\n"

In fact, most countries have laws that protect you from exactly that - for good reasons.

We need more digital security going forward, not less.  If a group other than the FBI was attempting to break into Apple's security using a backdoor, it would be seen as hacking and compromising security.  The court order puts the FBI in the place of being the attacking entity, working overtime to breach security and digital integrity of Apple's products.  Normally the good guys are on the side of principal and protection of our right to privacy, free speech, and security.  There is only a chance opening up 'the' phone will provide any valuable evidence that could prevent any other harmful activity, but forcing this back door to be created will guarantee that harm has been done to everyone that owns an Apple product and to everyone else who is effected by this precedent.

You cannot create something just for the \"good guys\" without high risk of allowing the bad guys in too. Forcing apple to develop a whole new OS or Tool to do this violates their freedom of speach rights by coercing them to say something (via computer code) they do not want to say. It places a high burden on them to create a whole team to design, build, test, maintain and defend a utility that will be challenged in court if created. Encryption is not some magic door the government seems to think it is, there can not be a master key that works when they want it to. The government has already bought off encryption companies in the past (RSA) to get their own back-door in, and it blew up in their face. A new law will not prevent the bad guys from using encryption thats already out there and in use."

    "comment": "Don't force Apple to work for the FBI. The ramifications are just too damaging. If it were just one specific phone, then maybe it would not be a giant issue. But the problem is that the FBI wants access to all phones. That's a no no. Consider this: if a law enforcement investigation required access to a home, through the proper channels they could get the landlord to grant them access. Understandable. But what if the same law enforcement group said, \"You know what, just give us keys to all of the homes and we'll just let ourselves in.\" That is not a good situation for me, you, or anyone else to be in! And I have nothing to hide! Forcing Apple to violate it's consumers' privacy is giving the FBI a skeleton key to ANY APPLE PRODUCT they want, whenever they want, whatever the reason -- justly or unjustly. And it won't stop there. You know it won't. Whenever a precedent is set, it can be abused many times before it's overturned. The problem with having a ruling on the books is that foreseeing all of the potential harm it could cause was absent in determining the judgement. Because remember, this is not a physical skeleton key. This is software. This is tech. And it's always under attack. So if Apple is FORCED to make their products LESS SECURE, then it is less secure to EVERYONE, regardless of their intentions. And for people with the know-how, or governments with the resources, a less secure target may be just what they need to execute whatever plans they had in the first place. Do not force Apple to loosen it's security. Even I don't have the foresight to see all of the hazards waiting down the road. But I do have the foresight to see that a decision that is not in favor of Apple and not in favor of maintaining strong security - and our privacy - is a bad one."

Nobody is fooled by this ploy. Nobody is fooled by the judiciary pretending to be independent when there are too many instances of travesties of justice documented in America being swept under the carpet by politically appointed doyens of law. The government in America is deeply flawed as is its huge plethora of state minions.

Of course the miscreant hackers are clever at data collection. You see it every day.\nNonsense to say that such a lessening in computing security would only be used in extreme cases.

Nor does it have access to information in our heads unless it's given during interrogation. Why can't an encrypted phone be any different?

The FBI cannot extend their responsibilities to the American people.  Encryption is a protection that is absolutely necessary and should not be broken to make the FBI or anyone else's job easier.  Today, I read an article in the St Paul newspaper, the Pioneer Press, which stated that an ISIS related hacking group released the personal information of many St Paul police officers, putting their families, communities, and themselves in grave danger.  Given the current vulnerabilities of online data, how could anyone argue against encryption?

They want everything, a police state that serves no purpose, protects no one, stops no terrorism.  \nJust like 9/11 they want to use fear as their tool to get people to surrender even more rights. \n\nWhat is even sillier that no one seems to notice the terrorists destroyed their 2 personal phones. Why did they not destroy the iphone?   They were not stupid and only destroyed the phones that had secret info on them.  \n\nWould you put anything secret on a work phone?  No.   \n\nThe FBI was careless, letting the IT guy at the health department improperly reset the password else  they would have everything on the phone.   The IT guy screwed it up. \n\nThere is nothing of value on that phone, no matter what anyone says.  \n"

After about three weeks after \"I am not a crook\" Nixon resigned, the U. S. Postal Service returned all of our mailings in two tied packets with no explanation (and no refund for our overseas postal charges).  We later sent the F.B.I. a freedom of information request to see if we were on Nixon's \"enemies list\" and were informed we weren't.  Go figure!"

While I understand the need to know what's going on in order to prevent terrorist and other dangerous criminal behavior, there has to be a rational balance between citizens' privacy and a government's ability to pry into personal affairs of its citizens. A government that allows little or no privacy is a destructive government, as history has shown. For example, when people's privacy is intruded upon by corporations, it gives those corporations the knowledge and power to target people for sales and monetary gain, and to control trends and buying patterns: in effect, telling people what they want or not, what to do and think. Governments should not have that power any more than corporations should. Think about it."

The FBI is merely looking for a precedent they can cite so they do not have to \"bother\" with civil liberty protections. Those protections are enshrined in our Constitution, and Bill of Rights. No one should be forced to \"speak\" under government threat. It is a core value that makes us Americans, and above most of the intrusions governments in the world. These rules are here to not only protect citizens but ensure the balance of power in our government. We only have to look at our current political climate to force the dangers of authoritarianism. I understand it is hard for some people, especially some of those in law enforcement to truly grasp what is at stake. Yes, it will be harder for them to catch \"the bad guys,\" however this system protects those in society who choose to live a more alternative lifestyle and protects them from being marginalized.

If you add a back door you're automatically adding an access point the someone with a malicious intend can exploit. Theft of information can be just as damaging if not worst than theft of actual possessions. This would allow for more identity theft/fraud. With all the recent hacks that have been happening throughout the world why would anyone want to give would be hackers an advantage. Code embedded in a devices that allows circumvention (even if only intended for use of the \"good guys\") can be discovered and exploited. Much like reverse engineering a physical product to see how it's made and replicate or modify it. Code can be viewed in certain situations in the attempt to find the way in. All it would take would be access to a device with the aforementioned code (in the FBI's world everything made) and then scrub it. When you own the device and have unlimited access it would only be a matter of time to find the exploit. Then the information gets distributed throughout the world. It would be discovered and \"fixed\" but after how many lives are ruined, destroyed, or private photos released, etc... Having already been given to the world. Once that information is out on the internet there is no putting it back, making it unseen, or undoing the damage. Just \"damage control\" to whatever limited extent the victim has at their disposal."

Shame on the FBI for exploiting this tragic event for their own benefit. This software is unneeded, there are other ways for the FBI to access this information (including our own CIA). "

However since private security experts have guaranteed they can solve the problem free of charge and within a few weeks it is clear that the issue is not about this phone, but about a desire to undo the unfavorable (to the FBI and to criminal hackers) decisions made in the 1990s that allowed e-commerce and secure encrypted banking documents. \nGiven the widespread corporate and even FBI vulnerability to hackers resulting from lax encryption and security methods of their own it is painfully obvious that we need more stringent encryption and security protocols, not less. \nI would much rather the FBI and NSA spent far more time stopping identity theft and financial fraud than trying to read the emails and private documents of citizens. \n\nThose hackers carefully exposing government crimes, fastidious in redacting names, should not be the targets. Rather their expertise and suggestions could be a foundation for greater security for us all. \n\nThere are many sources of information available to make educated decisions. A good introduction is the transcript of the conversation between Julian Assange, Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and State Department experts on the book titled \"When Google met Wikileaks.\""

They too said it was for the protection of security of public and government. The American public is tired of hearing the FBI, CIA and any other government agency taking away our rights to privacy and using the OLD excuses. Americans are slowly losing their rights because the government says they need to protect us. We do not need the government to protect us we will protect ourselves , when the time comes. If you keep approving the government request to take away our rights to privacy etc, you are essentaully taking away the pele rights that made America great. If you give a little piece of our rights away they will nev return and one day we won't need you, because the American public won't have any rights left to take away and America can change their name to nazi Germany's.

    "comment": "Weakening encryption on any level shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Information Theory. \n\nIt's not unidirectional:\nYou cannot weaken encryption without dramatically weakening the security around ALL activities based around that encryption. If the FBI can break into an ISIS iPhone on a whim, then ISIS can (or very soon will be able to) break into an FBI iPhone on a whim. \n\nIt's an international move:\nIf the U.S.A. requires that Apple make a universal iPhone key, then (regardless of the continued existence of that key) other countries will have precedence to request the same of Apple. There are many countries for which it is not in the best interest of the U.S.A. that they have a universal iPhone key (Russia, North Korea, South Korea, China... any under-developed nation... the list of morally dubious countries goes on and on). \n\nIt won't stop the bad guys:\nEven if you can decrypt an iPhone, you cannot necessarily decrypt the app-by-app data on that iPhone. Apps such as Telegram are an example of this. Ignoring this, illegal activity will just move off of iPhones to other phones that the U.S. cannot control. Do we really need to give Russia and China more economic power?\n\nIt will help the bad guys: \nOnce the box is open, anyone will be able to use its contents. The U.S. is already inundated by information security threats from China, Russia, etc. Purposefully weakening our shields is a terrible idea that will only let more of these attacks be successful. \n\nYou don't think it will get out?\nThink again. There is not a single example in the history of information technology in which a purposeful flaw was not eventually discovered. How do we know this? Old software goes open source where it is analyzed by thousands of competent programmers. It gets out. Apple is a huge company and many people would have access to this universal key. If it's not leaked by an Apple employee, there's still the issue of the FBI, then the other countries that Apple must now give a key... The number of trustworthy people required explodes. \n\nThe case specifics don't require it:\nThe iPhone in question belongs to the government anyway, so our shooter was unlikely to keep sensitive information on it to begin with. Ignoring that, there's every indication that this guy was pretty isolated in his workings. Even more so, the case is done -- new information is highly unlikely to contribute any value to the investigation WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. \n\nIt will literally kill people:\nSocietal health is a funny thing. For example: the recession literally took many unseen human lives. You don't see this on a person-by-person basis, but rather across the population as a whole. How many people ate low quality food for a few years? How many people lost their health care? How many people didn't see the dentist for a decade? These factors reduce a person's lifespan, and across the whole population, many thousands of years of life were lost as a result -- as a direct result of the recession. In this case, weakened security will allow for more data leaks, more hacks, more impersonations. This will add friction to the economy and companies will have to funnel more money into fraud protection and IT security. That will mean fewer jobs, which means worse off people. People who are victims of identity theft suffer massive stress and financial strife. This has consequences. It will create more dead people. \n\nIt will academically weaken the U.S.:\nAside from the manufacturing weakening from fewer people buying Apple products, there will be academic problems. Forcing Apple's hand will feed into the rise of anti-encryption sentiment. This could cause other encryption legislation to pass and weaken encryption in the U.S.. Encryption is a field in Information Theory which is a sub-field of Applied Mathematics. It is purely abstract and mathematical. To forcedly weaken encryption is akin to forcing physicists to pretend all atoms are actually pentahedrons. Will this change the true nature of atoms? No. Will it stop science from studying atoms in their full context? No. What it will do is force the science to move abroad. The U.S. will become a weaker academic power if encryption is weakened. All those hundreds of thousands of international students that come here? Some still will. Some will opt to go to Sweden, Russia, Japan, China... Get the idea? \n\nThere is no valid position for the mandated weakening of encryption. Apple is right, the FBI is power-hungry, and there is no controversy. "

Even the other \"security\" agencies have come out against this staggering overreach attempt to destroy privacy and encryption. Even the agencies that have themselves engaged in massive abuse of power, such as the NSA, have come out against this. They know that if encryption is destroyed the country is at much greater risk for attack, on many different levels, economic, infrastructure, military, cyberspace...\nThe FBI is also acting against the interests of US tech corporations, whose foreign markets (not to mention their domestic ones) depend on the ability of purchasers to buy products in whose security they can trust. The FBI intends to undermine precisely this security, putting not only individuals, but the entire US tech business world, at great risk. People and businesses will not buy products from companies whose products they believe are compromised. That is precisely what FBI/Comey/Obama intend to do. The FBI/Justice department demand is a sick, subversive, and thoroughly destructive demand to obliterate our security to benefit the power held by a few. It should be shot down, as treason, and a vicious attempt at economic sabotage, by people and groups in power intent on subverting our democracy and destroying our economy. In short, it is a demand by terrorists."

This proper request would both limit the cost of the contracted work for the government, and it would insulate the business, its product consumers, and even the potential market value of the company on the whole by preventing the abuse or misuse of such an aggressive means of access to personal and sensitive data as a \"universal hack.\" I perdonally do not even care for Apple's product offering, but I whole heartedly stand by their choice to protect consumer privacy and their own right to be compensated for work performed."

Instead of making us safer, it would make us less safe. The U.S. cannot count on always being ahead in technology, in access to technology and information, and in having the best hackers (technically, crackers) on the planet working strictly for us. I strongly suggest to the FBI, an agency which I respect, that the next time they need access to an iPhone they allow only those trusted individuals and teams who actually understand iPhone security procedures to have anything to do with the iPhone(s) in question. The FBI screwed up their own access to the information from the San Bernardino shooter's work iPhone. They can learn from this, but the lesson should not be to make it possible for outside forces to hack in to anybody's iPhone. After all, if Apple were to comply by creating a backdoor, couldn't that in itself potentially be used by an enemy to erase or falsify information on an iPhone of potential future interest to the FBI, or to other security agencies? I encourage the FBI to work with Apple rather than against Apple, pay attention and get their own procedures in order for the future. Thank you for reading my comments."

So if our government is funding and creating these terrorist organizations to do the dirty work of this country, who are the real terrorists? Enough American soldiers and civilians have died.

I am not for any Federally mandated back door for any device which has been secured for the person who spent a considerable amount of money for this type of security. The bigger issue in this saga is the fact people were able to buy Ak-47's yes the guns every American thinks is their right to own under the 2nd Amendment. This is the real issue and this case is just causing more smokescreens other than dealing with the real issue at hand which is three security/justice agencies not doing their JOB #doyourjob .

As ever more of our lives become digitally recorded, and as our nation becomes more interconnected, the threats to our civil liberties and to the very structure of our democracy ---to say nothing of the extreme threats we all might face if this technology were to fall \"into the wrong hands\"--- these threats are very real and they are tremendous.
